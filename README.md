Welcome to our first interview challenge!  As part of your mock interview, you'll be working on a coding exercise related to recommendation systems.  This exercise consists of 2 scenarios, easy and hard - the hard scenario will build on top of the work completed for the easy scenario.

You are limited to 45 minutes for this coding exercise.  If you're not able to complete both scenarios, that's ok!  We would prefer that you prioritize well-written, working code for only the easy scenario over messy, broken code for both scenarios.  

Easy Scenario:
  In this repo is a directory titled `sample_data`, which contains 5 CSV files describing information about restaurants.  Your coworkers will be creating a recommendation system for restaurants, but first they need the data.  Your job is to import the data in the CSV files into a database.  By the time you complete this scenario, you should be able to run a script titled `import_data.py` that will get the data stored in the CSVs and insert it into a database containing a table `Restaurants`.

 Hard Scenario:
 	So, it turns out that the coworker that's creating the recommendation system is, well, you.  Using the database you created in the previous scenario, create a recommendation system that will suggest a restaurant based on the user data provided below.
